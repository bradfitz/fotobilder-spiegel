ABOUT
=====

This program intelligently mirrors an entire FotoBilder account (all
galleries & pictures).  FotoBilder is the software the runs
LiveJournal's photo galleries, and previously ran picpix.com, which is
now apparently shutting down.

This tool fetches public galleries & photos only when passwords
aren't handy.

If you have the passwords, you should probably use the fotoup.pl
(found elsewhere) and its --backup mode, which uses the authenticated
fotobilder API.


INSTALLING
